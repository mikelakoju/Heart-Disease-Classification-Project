# Heart Disease Classification-Project
 
This project containts End-to-End Heart Disease Classification Project. 
* In this project, I first perform some exploratory data analysis on the dataset to identify patterns by comparing various features within the data. To establish a baseline model, 
* I then compare/ build three different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbours classifier and Random Forest Classifier) from Scikit-Learn. 
* Then I performed Hyperparameter tuning:
      * first by hand (with loops), 
      * then with RandomizedSearchCv and 
      * GridSearchCV 
* I also use 5-fold cross-validation. 
* Evaluation is performed using: 
      * Accuracy, 
      * ROC curve & AUC score, 
      * Confusion matrix, 
      * Classification report, 
      * Precision, 
      * Recall, 
      * F1-score.
