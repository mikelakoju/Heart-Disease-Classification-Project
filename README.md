# Heart Disease Classification-Project
### Author: Dr. Mike Lakoju 
This project containts End-to-End Heart Disease Classification Project. 
* In this project, I first perform some exploratory data analysis on the dataset to identify patterns by comparing various features within the data. To establish a baseline model, 
* I then compare/ build three different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbours classifier and Random Forest Classifier) from Scikit-Learn. 
* Then I performed Hyperparameter tuning:
         <ul>
            <li>first by hand (with loops),</li>
            <li>then with RandomizedSearchCV,</li>
            <li>GridSearchCV </li>
           </ul> 
      
* I also use 5-fold cross-validation. 
* Evaluation is performed using: 
 <ol>
  <li>Accuracy</li>
  <li>ROC curve & AUC score</li>
  <li>Confusion matrix</li>
  <li>Classification report</li>
  <li>Precision</li>
  <li>Recall</li>
  <li>F1-score</li>
</ol>
